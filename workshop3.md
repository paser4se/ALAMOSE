## Description
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->


Existence of such cybersecurity attacks and security weaknesses related to DevOps, necessitates integration of security into DevOps in order to reliably deploy software to end-users. An educational module that integrates cybersecurity concepts into DevOps-related artifacts can educate next generation professionals on DevOps-specific security concepts, and the differences in applying security practices for DevOps-related artifacts.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to 

- Gain experience on secure coding and static program analysis in Ansible.
- Understand potential security weaknesses in an Ansible scripts.
- Apply security static analysis tool to detect security weaknesses of Ansible scripts.

## Targeted courses

Software Security, Software Engineering, DevOps, Secure DevOps, Secure Software Engineering.

## Activities

### Pre-Lab Activities

- Introduction to `Ansible` scripts and how Ansible scripts can be parsed using `pyyaml`
- Demonstration of security weaknesses such as hard-coded passwords can exist in `Ansible` scripts.
- Discussion on concepts of information flow in an Ansible scripts and how it can be used to detect security weaknesses in `Ansible` script.

### Lab Activities 

- Finding out security weakness in Ansible scripts from provided directory of Ansible scripts.
- Reporting how the security weakness are propagated to other Ansible scripts.  

### Post-Lab Activities

- Providing feedback to students by commenting on their code.
- Describing the students how far off their solution from the solution.
