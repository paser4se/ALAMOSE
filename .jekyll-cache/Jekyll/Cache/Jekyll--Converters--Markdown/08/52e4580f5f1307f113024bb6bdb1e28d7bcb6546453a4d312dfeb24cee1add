<!-- {: .no_toc } -->

<p>A security weakness is an error, flaw such as insecure coding pattern that can lead to vulnerability. In the following example, we show an example of security weakness, suspicious comment in source code.</p>

<h2 id="flow-analysis">Flow Analysis</h2>

<p>A security weakness such as hard-coded secret can be propagated to other part of the program. A flow analysis is a process to identify how security weakenss such as insecure coding pattern in a program can propagate security weakness with in a software system. In the following example, we demonstrate how information can propagate to different parts of the program.</p>

<!-- ### [Pre-Lab Concept Dissemination]

Introduction to SaltStack scripts, and how SaltStack scripts can be parsed using pyyaml. -->

<!-- - Introduction to `SaltStack` scripts and how SaltStack scripts can be parsed using `pyyaml`
- Demonstration of security weaknesses such as hard-coded passwords can exist in `SaltStack` scripts.
- Discussion on concepts of information flow in an SaltStack scripts and how it can be used to detect security weaknesses in `SaltStack` script. -->

<!-- ### Hands-on Activity

Identify an instance of a security weakness in SaltStack scripts. -->

<!--
- Finding out security weakness in SaltStack scripts from provided directory of SaltStack scripts.
- Reporting how the security weakness are propagated to other SaltStack scripts.   -->

<!-- ### Post-Lab Activities

Identify more instances of security weaknesses in the SaltStack scrips by reading existing [research](https://akondrahman.github.io/publications/) -->

<!--
- Providing feedback to students by commenting on their code.
- Describing the students how far off their solution from the solution. -->
