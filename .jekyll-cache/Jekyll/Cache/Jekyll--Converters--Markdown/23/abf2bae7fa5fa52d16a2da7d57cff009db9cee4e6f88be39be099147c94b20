<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->

<p class="fs-6 fw-300">Existence of such cybersecurity attacks and security weaknesses related to DevOps, necessitates integration of security into DevOps in order to reliably deploy software to end-users. An educational module that integrates cybersecurity concepts into DevOps-related artifacts can educate next generation professionals on DevOps-specific security concepts, and the differences in applying security practices for DevOps-related artifacts.</p>

<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gain experience on secure coding and static program analysis in Ansible.</li>
  <li>Understand potential security weaknesses in an Ansible scripts.</li>
  <li>Apply security static analysis tool to detect security weaknesses of Ansible scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="targeted-courses">Targeted courses</h2>

<p>Software Security, Software Engineering, DevOps, Secure DevOps, Secure Software Engineering.</p>
