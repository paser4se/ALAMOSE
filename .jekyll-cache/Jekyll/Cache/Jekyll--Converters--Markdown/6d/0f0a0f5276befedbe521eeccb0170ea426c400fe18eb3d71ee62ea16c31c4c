<!-- ### [Pre-Lab Concept Dissemination]

Introduction to SaltStack scripts, and how SaltStack scripts can be parsed using pyyaml. -->

<!-- - Introduction to `SaltStack` scripts and how SaltStack scripts can be parsed using `pyyaml`
- Demonstration of security weaknesses such as hard-coded passwords can exist in `SaltStack` scripts.
- Discussion on concepts of information flow in an SaltStack scripts and how it can be used to detect security weaknesses in `SaltStack` script. -->

<!-- ### Hands-on Activity

Identify an instance of a security weakness in SaltStack scripts. -->

<!--
- Finding out security weakness in SaltStack scripts from provided directory of SaltStack scripts.
- Reporting how the security weakness are propagated to other SaltStack scripts.   -->

<!-- ### Post-Lab Activities

Identify more instances of security weaknesses in the SaltStack scrips by reading existing [research](https://akondrahman.github.io/publications/) -->

<!--
- Providing feedback to students by commenting on their code.
- Describing the students how far off their solution from the solution. -->
