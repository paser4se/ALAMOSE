<p>Introduction to Ansible scripts, and how Ansible scripts can be parsed using pyyaml.</p>

<!-- - Introduction to `Ansible` scripts and how Ansible scripts can be parsed using `pyyaml`
- Demonstration of security weaknesses such as hard-coded passwords can exist in `Ansible` scripts.
- Discussion on concepts of information flow in an Ansible scripts and how it can be used to detect security weaknesses in `Ansible` script. -->

<h3 id="hands-on-activity">Hands-on Activity</h3>

<p>Identify an instance of a security weakness in Ansible scripts.</p>

<!-- 
- Finding out security weakness in Ansible scripts from provided directory of Ansible scripts.
- Reporting how the security weakness are propagated to other Ansible scripts.   -->

<h3 id="post-lab-activities">Post-Lab Activities</h3>

<p>Identify more instances of security weaknesses in the Ansible scrips by reading existing <a href="https://akondrahman.github.io/publications/">research</a></p>

<!-- 
- Providing feedback to students by commenting on their code.
- Describing the students how far off their solution from the solution. -->
