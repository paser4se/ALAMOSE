## Description
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->


Identifying security weaknesses, such as hard-coded passwords in SaltStack scripts, which is used to implement the practice of IaC.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to

- Understand security weaknesses.
- Understand the flow of information to detect security weaknesses accurately.

## Targeted courses

Secure Software Development, Software and Systems Ssecurity, Software Engineering

<!-- View this site's [_config.yml](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/tree/master/_config.yml) file as an example. -->

## Activities
[Pre-Lab Concept Dissemination](./Module-7-Prelab.html)

[Hands-on Activity](./Module-7-hands-on.html)

[Post-Lab Activity](./Module-7-Postlab.html)

<!-- ### [Pre-Lab Concept Dissemination]

Introduction to SaltStack scripts, and how SaltStack scripts can be parsed using pyyaml. -->

<!-- - Introduction to `SaltStack` scripts and how SaltStack scripts can be parsed using `pyyaml`
- Demonstration of security weaknesses such as hard-coded passwords can exist in `SaltStack` scripts.
- Discussion on concepts of information flow in an SaltStack scripts and how it can be used to detect security weaknesses in `SaltStack` script. -->

<!-- ### Hands-on Activity

Identify an instance of a security weakness in SaltStack scripts. -->

<!--
- Finding out security weakness in SaltStack scripts from provided directory of SaltStack scripts.
- Reporting how the security weakness are propagated to other SaltStack scripts.   -->

<!-- ### Post-Lab Activities

Identify more instances of security weaknesses in the SaltStack scrips by reading existing [research](https://akondrahman.github.io/publications/) -->

<!--
- Providing feedback to students by commenting on their code.
- Describing the students how far off their solution from the solution. -->
