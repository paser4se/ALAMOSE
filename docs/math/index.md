# Math

The following pages demonstrate how users can customise the current version of Just the Docs to support automatic rendering of math formulae in Markdown.

the value of the `math` field in the front matter of a page determines which package to use for it.

The rendering of LaTeX math markup on web pages by the different packages is generally very close to the rendering of the same markup in PDFs by latex engines.
However, compatibility between LaTeX markup for math on web pages and PDFs is currently limited by lack of support for various commands and environments.
