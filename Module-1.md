## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this module, the student will be able to 

- Understand security weaknesses.
- Understand the flow of information to detect security weaknesses accurately.

## Targeted courses

Secure Software Development, Software and Systems Ssecurity, Software Engineering

<!-- View this site's [_config.yml](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/tree/master/_config.yml) file as an example. -->


## Activities

### Pre-Lab Concept Dissemination

Introduction to Ansible scripts, and how Ansible scripts can be parsed using pyyaml.

<!-- - Introduction to `Ansible` scripts and how Ansible scripts can be parsed using `pyyaml`
- Demonstration of security weaknesses such as hard-coded passwords can exist in `Ansible` scripts.
- Discussion on concepts of information flow in an Ansible scripts and how it can be used to detect security weaknesses in `Ansible` script. -->

### Hands-on Activity

Identify an instance of a security weakness in Ansible scripts.

<!-- 
- Finding out security weakness in Ansible scripts from provided directory of Ansible scripts.
- Reporting how the security weakness are propagated to other Ansible scripts.   -->

### Post-Lab Activities

Identify more instances of security weaknesses in the Ansible scrips by reading existing [research](https://akondrahman.github.io/publications/)

<!-- 
- Providing feedback to students by commenting on their code.
- Describing the students how far off their solution from the solution. -->
